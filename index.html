          Deadbeat was visiting Bluoupid Labs to return his broken mask, however upon entering a lost soul attempts to attack him as he shatters it's skull. He sees the doctor bleeding on the floor as he rushes over, the doctor pleads "Please... get out of here." Deadbeat, knowing he needed them to help him in the future, grabbed the doctors hand as he slowly watched him change into what could possibly be a zombie or a demon. Deadbeat reacting quickly bashes the Doctor's head into the ground, effective cracking it and stand tall infront of the gates of hell. 
          <br>"I'm gonna correct this mistake and save everyone from this unholy nightmare!"
          <br> 
          <br>
          Deadbeat, grabbed a rock and smashes a glass case and unleashes the duo of pain.
